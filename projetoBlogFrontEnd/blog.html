        <h4>AUGUST 11th, 2022</h4>
        
        <p>So... hello guys. I'm here to tell yall the history of how the first time I hang out with the <strong>love of my life</strong> went, which I guess you've figured out by the title. So, without further delay, here it goes the truth: our first date had everything to go <em>terribly</em> wrong. And <em>almost</em> went.<br><br>
        You must ask, why?... Well, I had discovered that I was in love with that girl a while back. We were from the same work group at college, and we went along pretty well, so I should've discovered sooner, <strong>which I didn't</strong>, cause I'm stupid sometimes. It's okay, she knows it and don't mind. Anyway, once i figure it out, I went crazy. I tried to hide it, pretend it wasn't a big of a deal, but I coudn't. Believe me, if yall knew her, you would understand why, she's just <em>perfect</em>.<br><br>
        Sorry, realized I'm blabbling here; let's just go straight to the date. After I went crazy about the subject, we still had to talk, because of the work group. That was uncomfortable at first, but very necessary for me to decide I just needed to know her better. So I started to send her text messages, trying to talk. That went okay, and every time I received her message I got the chills, even thought I didn't realized at the time.<br><br>
        After a little time talking throughout message, she created the chance for me to ask her out on a date, which I did <em>(absolutely freaking out. There's lots of me freaking out in our story, btw)</em>. We went to a exposition of the movie producer and writer Tim Burton. I got there late, <em>VERY</em> late, which was the first thing that went wrong. I could not even admire her beauty because of that; <br><br>
        The exposition was not that great, but we had the chance to talk in person, which was incredible. We also had the chance to have an awkward moment and a <em>pseudofight</em>. That was the second thing that went "wrong", and I'm mentioning this here just because it was important for me to realize she was insecure, so I would need to make everything in my power to make her get rid of that, make her realize that she could trust me, after all.<br><br>
        After all of that, you might be wondering if we just went our separate ways after the exposition... <strong>We didn't</strong>. We went to a burguer place nearby, had a few beers and talked a lot. The experience of talking to her, even about the most sensitive topics for me, was just so easy and amazing that I couldn't believe it was real. And I kind of felt that it was the same for her... But she was still a little suspicious of me, since all of it, my approach, my interest, etc., was kinda unexpected. After some time, I think she got over that (at least a little bit).<br><br>
        Anyway, we talked a lot about everything. I really didn't wanted it to end, but eventually it did. When we had to say goodbyes, I was very nervous, wondering if I would have to kiss her or something <em>(I am a very slow lover, if yall want me to name it)</em>. In the end, we didn't had our first kiss at this date, after all, but it was for the best. We still had to know each other better, and all this sort of thing. The fact that we did not kiss wasn't, in any sort of way, bad ou something that ruined our first date. Things just went so natural that a kiss was just not necessary at that moment... But it was, indeed, necessary in the next chapter of our story, as you will soon be able to see. <br><br>
        That's it for today, and that was our first date. Thank you all for read this, and till next time!
